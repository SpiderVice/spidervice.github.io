This Twitter thread has since been doing the rounds and has been shared by a bunch of the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rockstar-looks-to-have-removed-transphobic-content-from-gta-5s-next-gen-release/">gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-04-18-rockstar-appears-to-have-edited-transphobic-elements-in-gta-v-re-release">games industry</a> media, including <a href="https://www.outmaking.games/news1/rockstar-games-remove-transphobic-content-from-gtav">Out Making Games themselves</a>, who initially made the plea for R* to remove this content from the game in the current generation console release - which they did.</p><p>As this Twitter thread exploded and was widely shared, and Kirsty had mentioned the protagonist’s dialogue towards these characters, I decided to upload a “video” (just audio with the character’s names appearing on screen as they talked) that I had made that same week (but never published) with the voice lines extracted directly from the game’s files, just as below:</p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class="embed-container"> <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TtnNcz-raGU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The gaming media was reporting on it widely, so I decided to add more context to the thread, given I was tagged in it as well, credited for the screenshots from the PC version of GTA V (which still include the content as it was not yet updated).</p><h2 id="the-ban">The Ban<a href="#the-ban" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/TwitterBan_20220418/1.png" alt="banned-tweet" data-proofer-ignore> <em>The Tweet</em></p><p>As I submitted the above tweet in response to Kirsty’s aforementioned thread (which has more than enough context), I noticed it was taking a little longer than usual to submit. I had uploaded a 600 KB or so video, so I didn’t think much of it. That is until Twitter throws me into the following page, all of the sudden:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/TwitterBan_20220418/2.png" alt="banned-bullcrap" data-proofer-ignore> <em>The Ban</em></p><p>I had never been banned before on Twitter or any other social media. In fact, this came completely out of the blue, Twitter has actual explicit content, bigotry, hate, and more plain and simple bullshit where no one gets even a warning or a suspension. After shaking it off and yelling at everyone about it because it’s, well, bullshit, I ended up thinking it was because the dialogue in it was transphobic (but not more than many other tweets I’ve seen where actual slurs are slung and have been slung at even some of us?!), so I was willing to wait the 12 hours just fine… That means no doomscrolling on Twitter, no saying random stuff or retweeting community Snapmatics on the brand accounts, but welp, whatever.</p><p>That is until I open my e-mail to find the reason they allegedly banned me for: “<em>posting or sharing privately produced/distributed intimate media of someone without their express consent.</em>”</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>So not only it wasn’t due to transphobic content, but it was due to allegedly spreading sexual or explicit content from someone else without consent? This is a pretty severe mark on my account and even my morals, they are literally implying I engaged in some sort of revenge porn by posting <strong>audio voice lines from a video game</strong>. If you think I am exaggerating, I am not. This is what the official <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/intimate-media">Twitter Help Centre</a> says about it:</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/TwitterBan_20220418/4.png" alt="policy" data-proofer-ignore> <em>The policy I allegedly violated</em></p><p>It should be pretty obvious by now that my tweet and the video don’t fit in any of these points whatsoever. Hidden camera content - no. Creepshots - no! A deep fake? There is no moving images. Images or videos from an intimate setting? Very obviously not… The last one doesn’t even need comment.</p><p>I can kind of see where the second to last point fits, but I also can’t. Nothing in that video is even similar to some sort of private sex footage, they are characters being offensive but I <strong>very much doubt</strong> Twitter doesn’t have much more explicit, actually sexual audio in other tweets.</p><p>Was it Michael’s speech that made their crappy algorithm think it was a sex scene? And if so, where does “without their consent” come from? How was that determined? My tweet had nothing vengeful in it? It wasn’t even close to any of the examples they link in their Help Centre article. At this point you can probably imagine I’m fuming - I use Twitter often for all kinds of reasons, to connect with people I know, networking, highlight stuff from the Rockstar community, personal stuff, so on and so forth, it’s basically my main social media at the moment.</p><p>Suddenly, it all boils down to a bullshit “revenge porn” or whatever accusation due to a tweet that is speech from a video game. I’m pretty sure there’s far more suggestive and/or hateful dialogue from films and video games distributed on Twitter. You could argue the voice lines are hateful towards trans people, and yes, they kind of are, that was the point of highlighting their removal, but that somehow became a completely different thing?! This is audio extracted <a href="/assets/img/posts/TwitterBan_20220418/5.png">directly from GTA V</a>, I didn’t make it myself…</p><p>Twitter says this is a severe violation, despite the 12 hour ban, so I decided to appeal…</p><h2 id="the-appeal">The Appeal…<a href="#the-appeal" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Whilst going through Twitter’s Help Centre page, I found they had an appeals form. Given the severity of the violation, I decided to appeal instead of just wait it out, as I’m sure that will be in my account forever. This is what I told them:</p><hr /><p><em>“Earlier today, I posted a video including some audio lines from the video game Grand Theft Auto V, in reply to a Twitter thread about a subject that has made the news: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-04-18-rockstar-appears-to-have-edited-transphobic-elements-in-gta-v-re-release</em></p><p><em>This video included mere examples of characters from this game saying things to other characters in that game, with my original tweet (https://twitter.com/SpiderVice/status/1516114005680607245) very clearly contextualising the “video” and its contents.</em></p><p><em>I was surprised to see I had been suspended for “posting or sharing privately produced/distributed intimate media”, thus putting a stain on my account, when the content that was shared had nothing to do with what you have suspended me for. The Tweet I posted does not fit in any of the points specified in the Twitter Help Centre page for this kind of suspension - there was no nudity, no “creepshots”, no “revenge porn” or anything of the sort, it was merely voice lines from a video game that were relevant to news that are being spread at this very moment about transphobia in the aforementioned video game.</em></p><p><em>I feel this suspension is majorly unfair, especially given the content posted does not fit in any of the rule-breaking points mentioned whatsoever. I would like Twitter to review this because I feel like this is a major fault in your automated system. My account is in good standing, and I had never been suspended before for any reason.</em></p><p><em>Best regards.”</em></p><hr /><p>“Well, let’s see if that works”, I said. That is until I submit the appeal.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/TwitterBan_20220418/3.png" alt="banned-bullcrap" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>Enough niceties, fuck me sideways, this is not how I envisioned my evening today. If last night I was re-playing through Portal 2’s co-op levels to try and get an achievement, now I’m dealing with an absolutely incompetent social media algorithm, and my ban has been extended for appealing it. As an admin/moderator on a big and sometimes messy forum, I can see the reason for this, it allows the Twitter human teams to review the appeal whilst not letting you do anything else just in case… But the problem is, I probably won’t get a response in 12 hours.</p><p>I made the appeal because I didn’t want to have this stain on my account, it’s a very bad one and completely false at that. So my ban has just been extended from like 9 hours at the time of writing this, to god knows when because now it has to be manually reviewed and I don’t think Twitter is known to be fast with these things at all…</p><p>Fun times. I’m considering just cancelling the appeal and sucking it up, the problem is it’s a severe violation. If they for some reason think I’m sharing bad stuff again, I’ll be permanently banned.</p><p>This kind of thing should not be happening in 2022. With all the advancements in machine learning, AI and all the hiring a company like Twitter does, there’s kind of no excuse to not have a much more sophisticated system for this kind of thing - one that takes into consideration the contents in the tweet and not just the audio/video, the thread it’s a part of, the account’s previous tweets and standing, and well, more accuracy in determining whether the contents of the video are harmful in the way you say they are or not.</p><p>Twitter is full of bigotry, hate, phobias, ableism, you name it, you sometimes report these people and literally nothing happens, they get away scot free. Meanwhile… Sigh.</p><p>This will be updated with any news, I feel like I have an adventure ahead.</p><hr /><h2 id="updates">Updates<a href="#updates" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><h3 id="1904">19/04<a href="#1904" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>Late night update #1! It appears that Twitter has e-mailed me admitting that the ban was a mistake after my appeal!</p><p><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/TwitterBan_20220418/6.png" alt="twitter-istherehope" data-proofer-ignore></p><p>…except, although <a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderVice/status/1516114005680607245">the tweet</a> has been restored, I still cannot access my account and it says I still need to wait 3 hours! It’s no big deal, it unlocks early in the morning, but this 1. doesn’t sound like what they said in the e-mail, 2. I have a feeling the “infraction” is still going to be staining my account in their back-end…</p><h3 id="1904-2">19/04 2<a href="#1904-2" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3></h3><p>It’s now the late morning, by now I’ve woken up, checked my phone and… it appears that I was indeed unbanned, I just had to click a button to confirm and proceed to Twitter. My question is - has the “infraction” been removed from my account so they don’t accidentally think I’m sharing explicit content “again” and ban me for good? Because it sure as hell sounded like that in the e-mail, except it also said I should’ve been unbanned overnight and I wasn’t, I still had to wait until 7am.</p><p>I suppose at least the tweet also got restored! But I would have appreciated far more communication from Twitter and they really, REALLY need to get their auto moderation shit together.</p><p>Hopefully this is the end of it, over two accounts and 9 years on the platform I don’t think I had ever been banned for such a supposed “severe offence” out of the blue, when it wasn’t even anything of the sort.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/random-stuff/'>Random Stuff</a>, <a href='/categories/gta/'>GTA</a></div><div class="post-tags"> <i class="fa fa-tags fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href="/tags/social-media/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >social media</a> <a href="/tags/twitter/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >twitter</a> <a href="/tags/suspension/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >suspension</a> <a href="/tags/gaming/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >gaming</a> <a href="/tags/gta/" class="post-tag no-text-decoration" >gta</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A Twitter Jail Nightmare - Unfair Bans and Tribulations - Spider's Stuff&url=https://spidervice.github.io/posts/a-twitter-jail-nightmare/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/a-twitter-jail-nightmare/">A Twitter Jail Nightmare - Unfair Bans and Tribulations</a><li><a href="/posts/it-could-be-any-of-us/">It Could Be Any Of Us</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/social-media/">social media</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/gaming/">gaming</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/gta/">gta</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/phenomenon/">phenomenon</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/suspension/">suspension</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/twitter/">twitter</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/wordle/">wordle</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/the-wordle-phenomenon/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="timeago small" date="2022-01-11 21:16:00 +0000" >Jan 11</em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>The Wordle Phenomenon</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Worwhat?
