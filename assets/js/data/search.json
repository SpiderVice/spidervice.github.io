This Twitter thread has since been doing the rounds and has been shared by a bunch of the gaming and games industry media, including Out Making Games themselves, who initially made the plea for R* to remove this content from the game in the current generation console release - which they did.As this Twitter thread exploded and was widely shared, and Kirsty had mentioned the protagonist’s dialogue towards these characters, I decided to upload a “video” (just audio with the character’s names appearing on screen as they talked) that I had made that same week (but never published) with the voice lines extracted directly from the game’s files, just as below: The gaming media was reporting on it widely, so I decided to add more context to the thread, given I was tagged in it as well, credited for the screenshots from the PC version of GTA V (which still include the content as it was not yet updated).The BanThe TweetAs I submitted the above tweet in response to Kirsty’s aforementioned thread (which has more than enough context), I noticed it was taking a little longer than usual to submit. I had uploaded a 600 KB or so video, so I didn’t think much of it. That is until Twitter throws me into the following page, all of the sudden:The BanI had never been banned before on Twitter or any other social media. In fact, this came completely out of the blue, Twitter has actual explicit content, bigotry, hate, and more plain and simple bullshit where no one gets even a warning or a suspension. After shaking it off and yelling at everyone about it because it’s, well, bullshit, I ended up thinking it was because the dialogue in it was transphobic (but not more than many other tweets I’ve seen where actual slurs are slung and have been slung at even some of us?!), so I was willing to wait the 12 hours just fine… That means no doomscrolling on Twitter, no saying random stuff or retweeting community Snapmatics on the brand accounts, but welp, whatever.That is until I open my e-mail to find the reason they allegedly banned me for: “posting or sharing privately produced/distributed intimate media of someone without their express consent.”Excuse me?So not only it wasn’t due to transphobic content, but it was due to allegedly spreading sexual or explicit content from someone else without consent? This is a pretty severe mark on my account and even my morals, they are literally implying I engaged in some sort of revenge porn by posting audio voice lines from a video game. If you think I am exaggerating, I am not. This is what the official Twitter Help Centre says about it:The policy I allegedly violatedIt should be pretty obvious by now that my tweet and the video don’t fit in any of these points whatsoever. Hidden camera content - no. Creepshots - no! A deep fake? There is no moving images. Images or videos from an intimate setting? Very obviously not… The last one doesn’t even need comment.I can kind of see where the second to last point fits, but I also can’t. Nothing in that video is even similar to some sort of private sex footage, they are characters being offensive but I very much doubt Twitter doesn’t have much more explicit, actually sexual audio in other tweets.Was it Michael’s speech that made their crappy algorithm think it was a sex scene? And if so, where does “without their consent” come from? How was that determined? My tweet had nothing vengeful in it? It wasn’t even close to any of the examples they link in their Help Centre article. At this point you can probably imagine I’m fuming - I use Twitter often for all kinds of reasons, to connect with people I know, networking, highlight stuff from the Rockstar community, personal stuff, so on and so forth, it’s basically my main social media at the moment.Suddenly, it all boils down to a bullshit “revenge porn” or whatever accusation due to a tweet that is speech from a video game. I’m pretty sure there’s far more suggestive and/or hateful dialogue from films and video games distributed on Twitter. You could argue the voice lines are hateful towards trans people, and yes, they kind of are, that was the point of highlighting their removal, but that somehow became a completely different thing?! This is audio extracted directly from GTA V, I didn’t make it myself…Twitter says this is a severe violation, despite the 12 hour ban, so I decided to appeal…The Appeal…Whilst going through Twitter’s Help Centre page, I found they had an appeals form. Given the severity of the violation, I decided to appeal instead of just wait it out, as I’m sure that will be in my account forever. This is what I told them:“Earlier today, I posted a video including some audio lines from the video game Grand Theft Auto V, in reply to a Twitter thread about a subject that has made the news: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-04-18-rockstar-appears-to-have-edited-transphobic-elements-in-gta-v-re-releaseThis video included mere examples of characters from this game saying things to other characters in that game, with my original tweet (https://twitter.com/SpiderVice/status/1516114005680607245) very clearly contextualising the “video” and its contents.I was surprised to see I had been suspended for “posting or sharing privately produced/distributed intimate media”, thus putting a stain on my account, when the content that was shared had nothing to do with what you have suspended me for. The Tweet I posted does not fit in any of the points specified in the Twitter Help Centre page for this kind of suspension - there was no nudity, no “creepshots”, no “revenge porn” or anything of the sort, it was merely voice lines from a video game that were relevant to news that are being spread at this very moment about transphobia in the aforementioned video game.I feel this suspension is majorly unfair, especially given the content posted does not fit in any of the rule-breaking points mentioned whatsoever. I would like Twitter to review this because I feel like this is a major fault in your automated system. My account is in good standing, and I had never been suspended before for any reason.Best regards.”“Well, let’s see if that works”, I said. That is until I submit the appeal.Enough niceties, fuck me sideways, this is not how I envisioned my evening today. If last night I was re-playing through Portal 2’s co-op levels to try and get an achievement, now I’m dealing with an absolutely incompetent social media algorithm, and my ban has been extended for appealing it. As an admin/moderator on a big and sometimes messy forum, I can see the reason for this, it allows the Twitter human teams to review the appeal whilst not letting you do anything else just in case… But the problem is, I probably won’t get a response in 12 hours.I made the appeal because I didn’t want to have this stain on my account, it’s a very bad one and completely false at that. So my ban has just been extended from like 9 hours at the time of writing this, to god knows when because now it has to be manually reviewed and I don’t think Twitter is known to be fast with these things at all…Fun times. I’m considering just cancelling the appeal and sucking it up, the problem is it’s a severe violation. If they for some reason think I’m sharing bad stuff again, I’ll be permanently banned.This kind of thing should not be happening in 2022. With all the advancements in machine learning, AI and all the hiring a company like Twitter does, there’s kind of no excuse to not have a much more sophisticated system for this kind of thing - one that takes into consideration the contents in the tweet and not just the audio/video, the thread it’s a part of, the account’s previous tweets and standing, and well, more accuracy in determining whether the contents of the video are harmful in the way you say they are or not.Twitter is full of bigotry, hate, phobias, ableism, you name it, you sometimes report these people and literally nothing happens, they get away scot free. Meanwhile… Sigh.This will be updated with any news, I feel like I have an adventure ahead.Updates19/04Late night update #1! It appears that Twitter has e-mailed me admitting that the ban was a mistake after my appeal!…except, although the tweet has been restored, I still cannot access my account and it says I still need to wait 3 hours! It’s no big deal, it unlocks early in the morning, but this 1. doesn’t sound like what they said in the e-mail, 2. I have a feeling the “infraction” is still going to be staining my account in their back-end…19/04 2It’s now the late morning, by now I’ve woken up, checked my phone and… it appears that I was indeed unbanned, I just had to click a button to confirm and proceed to Twitter. My question is - has the “infraction” been removed from my account so they don’t accidentally think I’m sharing explicit content “again” and ban me for good? Because it sure as hell sounded like that in the e-mail, except it also said I should’ve been unbanned overnight and I wasn’t, I still had to wait until 7am.I suppose at least the tweet also got restored! But I would have appreciated far more communication from Twitter and they really, REALLY need to get their auto moderation shit together.Hopefully this is the end of it, over two accounts and 9 years on the platform I don’t think I had ever been banned for such a supposed “severe offence” out of the blue, when it wasn’t even anything of the sort." }, { "title": "It Could Be Any Of Us", "url": "/posts/it-could-be-any-of-us/", "categories": "Personal", "tags": "", "date": "2022-01-14 22:42:00 +0000", "snippet": "PrefaceThis is really not the kind of thing I’m used to type at all. Other times it has happened with older family members I’ve mostly bottled it up, I don’t get overly nihilistic over death, especially when it feels… “expected.” It’s going to happen to all of us, I like moving forward. This, however, is a first that hits a bit different. If not merely because of age and cause, so I felt like pouring some of it out here.It’s not my first rodeo. My paternal grandparents both died of prolonged disease and at an old age, but I suppose it was so gradual and “expected” that it was a bit different.It was just a normal day yesterday. A day like any other, I get out of bed, have my breakfast, do my personal things, a day like many others during this pandemic period. Not much going out of the house except for shopping, exercise or other random occasions/scheduled stuff. Logging in on Twitter and posting my randomness, reading people’s tweets, retweeting pics or other interesting (or depressing) things, looking at people getting outraged over the smallest things - or happy over the smallest things! Playing videogames, screwing around with friends on Discord.You see, sometimes in films and even those motivational texts, they always say that things can change suddenly, all of that stuff. And the truth is, they might be kind of lame, but realistic in the hardest moments.A “normal” dayLater that day I go for a shower. It’s warm and comfy in there, I usually take my time - I mean, who DOESN’T have shower thoughts and deep moments of introspection?! That is until someone I’m with at home barges in and says they have to leave immediately as something is happening to another family member.This family member is not a blood-related family member, but it was someone we were all extremely close to. Saw very often. Someone that had their batteries constantly charged, saw life in such a positive and forward-thinking way, absolutely one of the coolest people I knew, even if our world views didn’t really match (which kind of happens with most of my family anyway, let’s say I might be a bit too “progressive” for some of them who have more “traditional” ways of thinking, but I digress).That changed last year, as they were diagnosed with relatively advanced lung cancer. They were an extremely heavy smoker, and it’s one of those things you don’t really think about until… it hits. Doctors thought it was treatable, so soon after they were put on therapy (chemo &amp;amp; radiotherapy I believe). It brought them down a lot. All the energy they had was quickly depleted, which is something we were all ready for, after seeing other family members go through cancer treatment.Good news? Well… “Good news, the lung cancer is smaller!”A while after, the light at the end of the tunnel we were all waiting for. Could this be it? Lung cancer has one of the highest mortality rates… Well… unfortunately - no. It had metastasised to their stomach. Treatments had to continue, with all the associated side effects, depleting their batteries even more. The massive energy that emanated from them was all gone as they battled the cancer.More and more the treatments (and the advancing of the cancer) start wearing them down. It complicates and they need to be hospitalised. It’s very common for chemo/immuno/radiotherapy or a combination of those to cause major health issues like anaemia and so on. So we all agreed that they needed an extra push, and not to stay at home suffering like this, instead being taken care of in a hospital setting.After this, it was all a blur. They were sent back home eventually, with their significant other taking care of them. They barely ate, but could walk, still watch TV, enjoy things, even in this situation they just couldn’t and didn’t want to stop. After all their whole life they didn’t stop.Back to yesterdayDespite everything, I still had some hope that all of these symptoms were just part of the cancer treatment. But just like there are many people who go through this and survive, then recover, others… don’t.What happened during that shower was revealing. The moment I heard the panic coming from outside and people having to leave, I “knew”. I quickly finish as I’m left alone and step out of the shower, expecting the worst. 20 minutes later I get a call - yup. There it is.A 40 year old that had all the energy in the world. I remember thinking they were cool since I was a wee one in the early 2000’s. I remember listening to European electronic music hits because of them, as it was cool to play Trance music at glass-shattering volume back then, to show everyone you were a clubber. Which they were in fact, as far as I’ve been told! This track has been stuck in my head since I was like 6 years old most probably, because of them.All these years later, that battery is suddenly depleted with that god damned fucking thing called cancer. One of the most complex diseases known to humankind, one that is hard to fully manage, that is not handled the same by everyone, without a global treatment that can cure all types and fit all people. At the snap of a finger. 40 years of energy depleted in not even one year. Terrifying.Today was a strange day, an obvious day of grief. Tomorrow even more as it’s the funeral, so.. there’s that.It could be any of usYesterday I mentioned in a (admittedly vague, which scared a couple people, and I apologise) tweet that if something is wrong with you, if you feel something isn’t right, please don’t delay it and get checked ASAP. I’ve been called a hypochondriac by dozens of people in my life, including close family, for worrying too much about things, but I honestly think this is better than finding out something is wrong too late.It can be any of us. We may not even know we have something until we truly get checked. Living life in fear is not the solution, in fact, quite the opposite, but scheduling regular checkups, having a think about stuff like tobacco addictions (if that’s your case) and scheduling a checkup, as afraid as you may be of the results, is ALWAYS worth it.Heavy post, but I’ll be fineAs for me… I know this was an extremely heavy post, but I’ll be fine. As I mentioned at the beginning I like moving forward, I’m the kind of guy who thinks he’s an unlucky son of a bitch constantly, that life tries to balance every good thing that happens to him with something bad, but also gets giddy at the smallest positive thing, perhaps a little too much. Sometimes maybe not even mutually when my giddiness is with someone else, but every small or big positive moment and situation matters. And I think it’s a healthy way to see things, especially in what seems to be the age of social media and pseudo-keyboard warriors.These situations put life and its fragility into perspective, but I don’t like living in fear or constantly introspecting about what’s coming. The pandemic has sent me into a darker abyss than usual in general, but I’ve been able to see a lot of joy in the kinds of things that people usually shun, which help me go through these moments. I like interacting with people online, knowing other like-minded (and fuckin’ awesome) people and being part of the communities I’ve been a part of for so many years now, and it’s something I intend to be doing for as long as possible. Through that I’ve met some genuinely great people who I would definitely hang out with IRL, for example, honestly.Cherish life and all the small moments, don’t let all the silly shit that’s coming out during the pandemic from all kinds of already deranged people get to you, look forward, be yourselves and live your lives, because it could be any of us.This might not make a ton of sense but I just had to type it down. Quite a weight that’s come off my shoulders. I’ll be here and you’re all gonna have to hear me and my silly jokes as usual, I’m not going anywhere. 😉 Grieving, but not going anywhere.Fuck cancer." }, { "title": "The Wordle Phenomenon", "url": "/posts/the-wordle-phenomenon/", "categories": "Random Stuff", "tags": "social media, wordle, phenomenon", "date": "2022-01-11 21:16:00 +0000", "snippet": "Worwhat?I’m sure by now everyone that has an account on Twitter, and perhaps even other social media websites is already aware that a bunch of their friends and/or followers might be posting a bunch of coloured squares.

Did the Matrix leak into the real world?Even I have done it!Word guessing based games have always been all the rage online and offline, after all it wasn’t that long ago that a lot of us were playing Words With Friends on Facebook or even outside Facebook. But at the end of last year a new one took the social media world by storm: Wordle!I’ll be honest, not even I know how exactly this exploded, I just started seeing a lot of my Twitter follows posting these coloured squares mentioning a word game, until I caved in and investigated.Now, it’s all fun and games until I realise I’m not an English native. I’d say my English is pretty good considering that fact, but my vocabulary not always is the most varied. So most days I’ve been trying to play this I just get zeroes. That only changed today (as I’m writing this) where I finally got one, and a pretty easy one at that, at least.What are the rules on this thingamajig?Because I’m most likely not going to be showing this off the day I’m typing it (unless someone sneaky finds the repo), I’ll just show today’s result.It’s all pretty simple. You have six tries to guess a five letter word. Dark blocks mean the word doesn’t have that letter whatsoever; Yellow blocks mean that the word DOES have that letter, but it’s in the wrong place; A green block means that you guessed the letter AND its position.From the results you get, you have to try and infer what the word could be:It seems easy enough, and it is, until you try a bunch of words and realise you’re out of tries. It cycles every 24 hours, so if you screw it up, you’re out of luck until midnight UK time.It’s a fun little game, perhaps a little addicting, but I don’t see myself dedicated to solving it every day, even because I will most likely fail most rounds!Check out the author!Josh aka powerlanguage’s sitepowerlanguage’s GitHub (Warning, it contains a repo with word lists that could be an accidental Wordle spoiler!)powerlanguage’s Twitter" } ]
