Other times it has happened with older family members I’ve mostly bottled it up, I don’t get overly nihilistic over death, especially when it feels… “expected.” It’s going to happen to all of us, I like moving forward. This, however, is a first that hits a bit different. If not merely because of age and cause, so I felt like pouring some of it out here.</p><p>It’s not my first rodeo. My paternal grandparents both died of prolonged disease and at an old age, but I suppose it was so gradual and “expected” that it was a bit different.</p><p>It was just a normal day yesterday. A day like any other, I get out of bed, have my breakfast, do my personal things, a day like many others during this pandemic period. Not much going out of the house except for shopping, exercise or other random occasions/scheduled stuff. Logging in on Twitter and posting my randomness, reading people’s tweets, retweeting pics or other interesting (or depressing) things, looking at people getting outraged over the smallest things - or happy over the smallest things! Playing videogames, screwing around with friends on Discord.</p><p>You see, sometimes in films and even those motivational texts, they always say that things can change suddenly, all of that stuff. And the truth is, they might be kind of lame, but realistic in the hardest moments.</p><h2 id="a-normal-day">A “normal” day<a href="#a-normal-day" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Later that day I go for a shower. It’s warm and comfy in there, I usually take my time - I mean, who DOESN’T have shower thoughts and deep moments of introspection?! That is until someone I’m with at home barges in and says they have to leave immediately as something is happening to another family member.</p><p>This family member is not a blood-related family member, but it was someone we were all extremely close to. Saw very often. Someone that had their batteries constantly charged, saw life in such a positive and forward-thinking way, absolutely one of the coolest people I knew, even if our world views didn’t really match (which kind of happens with most of my family anyway, let’s say I might be a bit too “progressive” for some of them who have more “traditional” ways of thinking, but I digress).</p><p><strong>That changed last year, as they were diagnosed with relatively advanced lung cancer.</strong> They were an extremely heavy smoker, and it’s one of those things you don’t really think about until… it hits. Doctors thought it was treatable, so soon after they were put on therapy (chemo &amp; radiotherapy I believe). It brought them down a lot. All the energy they had was quickly depleted, which is something we were all ready for, after seeing other family members go through cancer treatment.</p><h2 id="good-news-well">Good news? Well…<a href="#good-news-well" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><blockquote><p>“Good news, the lung cancer is smaller!”</p></blockquote><p>A while after, the light at the end of the tunnel we were all waiting for. Could this be it? Lung cancer has one of the highest mortality rates… Well… unfortunately - no. It had metastasised to their stomach. Treatments had to continue, with all the associated side effects, depleting their batteries even more. The massive energy that emanated from them was all gone as they battled the cancer.</p><p>More and more the treatments (and the advancing of the cancer) start wearing them down. It complicates and they need to be hospitalised. It’s very common for chemo/immuno/radiotherapy or a combination of those to cause major health issues like anaemia and so on. So we all agreed that they needed an extra push, and not to stay at home suffering like this, instead being taken care of in a hospital setting.</p><p>After this, it was all a blur. They were sent back home eventually, with their significant other taking care of them. They barely ate, but could walk, still watch TV, enjoy things, even in this situation they just couldn’t and didn’t want to stop. After all their whole life they didn’t stop.</p><h2 id="back-to-yesterday">Back to yesterday<a href="#back-to-yesterday" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Despite everything, I still had some hope that all of these symptoms were just part of the cancer treatment. But just like there are many people who go through this and survive, then recover, others… don’t.</p><p>What happened during that shower was revealing. The moment I heard the panic coming from outside and people having to leave, I “knew”. I quickly finish as I’m left alone and step out of the shower, expecting the worst. 20 minutes later I get a call - yup. There it is.</p><p>A 40 year old that had all the energy in the world. I remember thinking they were cool since I was a wee one in the early 2000’s. I remember listening to European electronic music hits because of them, as it was cool to play Trance music at glass-shattering volume back then, to show everyone you were a clubber. Which they were in fact, as far as I’ve been told! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IksRDCMYnn8">This track</a> has been stuck in my head since I was like 6 years old most probably, because of them.</p><p>All these years later, that battery is suddenly depleted with that god damned fucking thing called cancer. One of the most complex diseases known to humankind, one that is hard to fully manage, that is not handled the same by everyone, without a global treatment that can cure all types and fit all people. At the snap of a finger. 40 years of energy depleted in not even one year. Terrifying.</p><p>Today was a strange day, an obvious day of grief. Tomorrow even more as it’s the funeral, so.. there’s that.</p><h2 id="it-could-be-any-of-us">It could be any of us<a href="#it-could-be-any-of-us" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>Yesterday I mentioned in a (admittedly vague, which scared a couple people, and I apologise) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderVice/status/1481740279304667143">tweet</a> that if something is wrong with you, if you feel something isn’t right, please don’t delay it and get checked ASAP. I’ve been called a hypochondriac by dozens of people in my life, including close family, for worrying too much about things, but I honestly think this is better than finding out something is wrong too late.</p><p>It can be any of us. We may not even know we have something until we truly get checked. Living life in fear is not the solution, in fact, quite the opposite, but scheduling regular checkups, having a think about stuff like tobacco addictions (if that’s your case) and scheduling a checkup, as afraid as you may be of the results, is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> worth it.</p><h2 id="heavy-post-but-ill-be-fine">Heavy post, but I’ll be fine<a href="#heavy-post-but-ill-be-fine" class="anchor"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2></h2><p>As for me… I know this was an extremely heavy post, but I’ll be fine. As I mentioned at the beginning I like moving forward, I’m the kind of guy who thinks he’s an unlucky son of a bitch constantly, that life tries to balance every good thing that happens to him with something bad, but also gets giddy at the smallest positive thing, perhaps a little too much. Sometimes maybe not even mutually when my giddiness is with someone else, but every small or big positive moment and situation matters. And I think it’s a healthy way to see things, especially in what seems to be the age of social media and pseudo-keyboard warriors.</p><p>These situations put life and its fragility into perspective, but I don’t like living in fear or constantly introspecting about what’s coming. The pandemic has sent me into a darker abyss than usual in general, but I’ve been able to see a lot of joy in the kinds of things that people usually shun, which help me go through these moments. I like interacting with people online, knowing other like-minded (and fuckin’ awesome) people and being part of the communities I’ve been a part of for so many years now, and it’s something I intend to be doing for as long as possible. Through that I’ve met some genuinely great people who I would definitely hang out with IRL, for example, honestly.</p><p>Cherish life and all the small moments, don’t let all the silly shit that’s coming out during the pandemic from all kinds of already deranged people get to you, look forward, be yourselves and live your lives, because it could be any of us.</p><p>This might not make a ton of sense but I just had to type it down. Quite a weight that’s come off my shoulders. I’ll be here and you’re all gonna have to hear me and my silly jokes as usual, I’m not going anywhere. 😉 Grieving, but not going anywhere.</p><p>Fuck cancer.</p></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/personal/'>Personal</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="license-wrapper"> This post is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"> CC BY 4.0 </a> by the author.</div><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=It Could Be Any Of Us - Spider's Stuff&url=https://spidervice.github.io/posts/it-could-be-any-of-us/" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Twitter"> <i class="fa-fw fab fa-twitter"></i> </a> <i id="copy-link" class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link" title-succeed="Link copied successfully!"> </i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"><div class="panel-heading">Recently Updated</div><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/a-twitter-jail-nightmare/">A Twitter Jail Nightmare - Unfair Bans and Tribulations</a><li><a href="/posts/it-could-be-any-of-us/">It Could Be Any Of Us</a></ul></div><div id="access-tags"><div class="panel-heading">Trending Tags</div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap mt-3 mb-1 mr-3"> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/social-media/">social media</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/gaming/">gaming</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/gta/">gta</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/phenomenon/">phenomenon</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/suspension/">suspension</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/twitter/">twitter</a> <a class="post-tag" href="/tags/wordle/">wordle</a></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"><div class="panel-heading pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</div><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="tail-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/a-twitter-jail-nightmare/"><div class="card-body"> <em class="timeago small" date="2022-04-18 22:18:00 +0100" >Apr 18</em><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>A Twitter Jail Nightmare - Unfair Bans and Tribulations</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> Context A week or so ago, fellow GTANet admin Kirsty wrote a Twitter thread about the removal of transphobic content from Rockstar’s GTA V.
