## Worwhat?
I'm sure by now everyone that has an account on Twitter, and perhaps even other social media websites is already aware that a bunch of their friends and/or followers might be posting a bunch of coloured squares. Light, dark, yellow, green, you have it.

Have they finally lost it? Did the Matrix leak into the real world?

_Even I have done it!_

Word guessing based games have always been all the rage online and offline, after all it wasn't that long ago that a lot of us were playing [Words With Friends](https://www.zynga.com/games/words-with-friends-2/) on Facebook or even outside Facebook. But at the end of last year a new one took the social media world by storm: [**Wordle**](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)!

I'll be honest, not even I know how exactly this exploded, I just started seeing a lot of my Twitter follows posting these coloured squares mentioning a word game, until I caved in and investigated.

Now, it's all fun and games until I realise I'm not an English native. I'd say my English is pretty good considering that fact, but my vocabulary not always is the most varied. So most days I've been trying to play this I just get zeroes. That only changed today (as I'm writing this) where I finally got one, and a pretty easy one at that, at least.

## What are the rules on this thingamajig?
Because I'm most likely not going to be showing this off the day I'm typing it (unless someone sneaky finds the repo), I'll just show today's result.

It's all pretty simple. You have six tries to guess a five letter word.
* Dark blocks mean the word doesn't have that letter whatsoever; 
* Yellow blocks mean that the word DOES have that letter, but it's in the wrong place;
* A green block means that you guessed the letter AND its position.

From the results you get, you have to try and infer what the word could be:

It seems easy enough, and it is, until you try a bunch of words and realise you're out of tries. It cycles every 24 hours, so if you screw it up, you're out of luck until midnight UK time.

It's a fun little game, perhaps a little addicting, but I don't see myself dedicated to solving it every day, even because I will most likely fail most rounds!
